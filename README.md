# CXR-XAI: Chest X-Ray Explainable AI

## Project Description

This research project aims to develop an advanced system for analyzing chest X-ray images to detect COVID-19 and other related lung conditions using artificial intelligence techniques. The project combines state-of-the-art image processing, deep learning classification, and explainable AI methodologies to create a comprehensive solution for medical professionals.

### Key Objectives:

1. Develop an accurate classification model for identifying COVID-19, normal cases, viral pneumonia, and lung opacity from chest X-ray images.
2. Implement explainable AI techniques to provide interpretable results, enhancing trust and understanding in the model's decisions.
3. Generate automated medical reports based on the classification results and explainable AI insights.

### Methodology:

The project follows a three-step approach:

1. **Preprocessing**: 
   - Apply various image filtering techniques to enhance image quality.
   - Perform lung segmentation using U-Net to focus on the relevant areas of the X-ray.

2. **Classification and Evaluation**: 
   - Utilize deep learning models with attention mechanisms (e.g., CBAM) for accurate classification.
   - Implement explainable AI techniques to visualize and interpret the model's decision-making process.

3. **LLM-based Medical Report Generation**: 
   - Leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically generate detailed medical reports.
   - Incorporate classification results and XAI insights into the report generation process.

### Dataset:

The project uses the COVID-19 Radiography Database, a multi-center dataset containing 21,164 chest X-ray images across four categories: COVID-19, Normal, Viral Pneumonia, and Lung Opacity.

### Expected Outcomes:

- A robust and interpretable AI model for COVID-19 and related lung condition detection from chest X-rays.
- An automated system for generating comprehensive medical reports based on X-ray analysis.
- Improved diagnostic support for medical professionals, potentially leading to faster and more accurate diagnoses.

This research contributes to the ongoing efforts in combating COVID-19 and improving medical imaging analysis through the application of cutting-edge AI technologies.
